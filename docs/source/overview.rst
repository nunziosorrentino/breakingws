Overview
========

The tools provided by BreakinGWs can generate simple images data
sets (circles, rectangles, ellipses and lines), in order to start using it
with the proposed CNN algorithms:

* ``genimages.py``: produce a set of images in *data* folder;
* ``runcnn.py``: mean tool of the package, apply the CNN algorithm to a 
set of images with the relative labels, in order to predict the class of 
new images.
